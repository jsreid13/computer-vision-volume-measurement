# computer-vision-volume-measurement
Takes an image of a beaker with 2 liquid layers and is able to determine the volume of each layer based on the position of the top 
surface of the liquid relative to the tick marks. The number are determined by comparing the detected numbers to a set of letters I
made to train the algorithm on as well as an image of what the overage tick mark looks like to compare potential other tick marks detected
in the image to.
